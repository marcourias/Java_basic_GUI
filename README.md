# Java_basic_GUI

This is a basic program to practice and put some work on NetBeans JAVA GUI tools. 
This program uses different classes to create JFrames, where data can be input by the user. 
Therefore, the program allows the user to input employees for a company dedicated to a beauty salon, also to have a control over the supplies of the business.
A local database can be used to store the data, in development a MySQL database was used, which has 2 tables named "employees" and "supplies".
