# Java_basic_GUI

This is a basic program to practice and put some work on NetBeans JAVA GUI tools. 
This program uses different classes to create JFrames, where data can be input by the user. 
Therefore, the program allows the user to input employees for a company dedicated to a beauty salon, also to have a control over the supplies of the business.
A local database can be used to store the data, in development a MySQL database was used, which has 2 tables named "employees" and "supplies".


## Getting Started

The program was compiled in a .jar file, which can be downloaded and run in any machine with JVM.


## Usage
When run, the program opens a window with a Menu bar and 3 Menu Items called:
1. Personal (Personnel)
2. Material (Supplies)
3. Salir (Exit)
